* Write a new function resolve_uri that handles looking up resources on
  disk using the URI.

  * It should map the pathname represented by the URI to a filesystem
    location.

  * It should have a 'home directory', and look only in that location.

  * If the URI is a directory, it should return a plain-text listing and the
    mimetype ``text/plain``.

  * If the URI is a file, it should return the contents of that file and its
    correct mimetype.

  * If the URI does not map to a real location, it should raise an exception
    that the server can catch to return a 404 response.

* Write a new function response_not_found that returns a 404 response if the
  resource does not exist.

* Update the code in the server loop to use the new and changed functions you
  completed for the tasks above.
